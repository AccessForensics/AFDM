ACCESS FORENSICS
INTAKE DETERMINATION
MATTER ID: [AF-YYYY-NNNN]

DETERMINATION: ELIGIBLE FOR DESKTOP TECHNICAL RECORD BUILD
MOBILE BASELINE: CONSTRAINED

Based on Access Forensics intake assessment of the complaint or demand materials provided, this matter qualifies for cryptographically sealed technical record production under our controlled capture protocols on desktop baseline, limited to the claims asserted in the submitted materials.

This determination reflects feasibility under a bounded intake gate and does not quantify the number of conditions present or absent.

BASELINE EXECUTION CONTEXTS:
Desktop baseline is executed at 1366 x 900 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom. Mobile baseline is attempted at 393 x 852 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom in portrait orientation. Browser version is recorded in the execution log. Reflow is evaluated separately per WCAG 1.4.10 using both direct and zoom-path methods.

MOBILE CONSTRAINT RECORD:
CONSTRAINT CLASS: {{CONSTRAINT_CLASS}}
( {{CONSTRAINT_GLOSS}} )

If counsel requires allegation-scoped verification on mobile, access may be provided through an attorney-directed authorized lane. If an authorized lane is provided, verification can be re-attempted on mobile under the same locked baseline contexts, with the lane and its source explicitly recorded in the execution record.

NEXT STEPS:
Full engagement involves execution under the defined desktop browser context pursuant to our controlled capture protocols. All capture artifacts are logged, time-stamped, and sealed within a structured evidentiary packet utilizing industry-standard cryptographic integrity verification (SHA-256) and documented chain-of-custody controls.

The evidentiary packet includes, as applicable to the claims asserted in the submitted materials: high-resolution screenshots, page source and DOM captures, rendered text extracts, network activity records including requests, responses, headers, and timing data, console and runtime logs, interaction and navigation logs, and environment metadata including viewport, user agent, device profile, and execution settings. Each artifact is indexed within a structured manifest and bound to a packet hash.
