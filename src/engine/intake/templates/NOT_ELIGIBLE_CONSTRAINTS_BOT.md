ACCESS FORENSICS
INTAKE DETERMINATION
MATTER ID: [AF-YYYY-NNNN]

DETERMINATION: NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FORENSIC EXECUTION - CONSTRAINTS

Based on Access Forensics intake assessment of the complaint or demand materials provided, this matter does not satisfy intake criteria for controlled execution under our capture protocols due to defined parameter constraints as applied to the claims asserted in the submitted materials. No further testing will be performed.

If baseline access is intercepted by an automated challenge layer or bot mitigation system, Access Forensics does not attempt to defeat or bypass that barrier under allegation-scoped posture. The constraint is treated as a material feasibility event for reproducibility and is documented in the intake record.

BASELINE EXECUTION CONTEXTS:
Desktop baseline is executed at 1366 x 900 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom. Mobile baseline is executed at 393 x 852 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom in portrait orientation. Browser version is recorded in the execution log. Reflow is evaluated separately per WCAG 1.4.10 using both direct and zoom-path methods.

CONSTRAINT CLASS: BOTMITIGATION
( Automated challenge layer intercepted baseline request )

COUNSEL ACTION OPTION, AUTHORIZED LANE:
If counsel requires allegation-scoped verification of the alleged flow, access may be provided through an attorney-directed authorized lane such as a temporary allowlist window, storefront password, preview link, or equivalent authorized access mechanism.

If an authorized lane is subsequently provided by counsel, this determination will be superseded by a new intake determination reflecting the access conditions under which verification proceeded. The authorized lane and its source will be explicitly stated in the updated determination.
