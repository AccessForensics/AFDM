ACCESS FORENSICS
INTAKE DETERMINATION
MATTER ID: [AF-YYYY-NNNN]

DETERMINATION: NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FORENSIC EXECUTION - CONSTRAINTS

Based on Access Forensics intake assessment of the complaint or demand materials provided, this matter does not satisfy intake criteria for controlled execution under our capture protocols due to defined parameter constraints as applied to the claims asserted in the submitted materials. No further testing will be performed.

Access Forensics does not attempt to defeat or bypass technical barriers under allegation-scoped posture. Constraints are treated as material feasibility events and are documented in the intake record.

BASELINE EXECUTION CONTEXTS:
Desktop baseline is executed at 1366 x 900 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom. Mobile baseline is executed at 393 x 852 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom in portrait orientation. Browser version is recorded in the execution log. Reflow is evaluated separately per WCAG 1.4.10 using both direct and zoom-path methods.

CONSTRAINT CLASS: {{CONSTRAINT_CLASS}}
( {{CONSTRAINT_GLOSS}} )

If counsel provides an attorney-directed authorized lane appropriate to the constraint class, Access Forensics can issue a superseding intake determination reflecting the access conditions under which verification proceeded. The authorized lane and its source will be explicitly stated in the updated determination.
