ACCESS FORENSICS
INTAKE DETERMINATION
MATTER ID: [AF-YYYY-NNNN]

DETERMINATION: NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FORENSIC EXECUTION - CONSTRAINTS

Based on Access Forensics intake assessment of the complaint or demand materials provided, this matter does not satisfy intake criteria for controlled execution under our capture protocols due to defined parameter constraints as applied to the claims asserted in the submitted materials. No further testing will be performed.

If baseline access is intercepted by an automated challenge layer, access control, geofencing, or other technical barrier, Access Forensics does not attempt to defeat or bypass that barrier under allegation-scoped posture. The constraint is treated as a material feasibility event for reproducibility and is documented in the intake record.

CONSTRAINT CLASS: [BOTMITIGATION / AUTHWALL / GEOBLOCK / HARDCRASH / NAVIMPEDIMENT]
PLAIN-LANGUAGE BASIS: [One-line description of what was detected in the baseline lane]

A constraint artifact package documenting this feasibility event, including timestamped run artifacts, response header records, and a challenge fingerprint (SHA-256), is available as a case record.

AUTHORIZED LANE OPTION:
If counsel requires allegation-scoped verification of the alleged flow, access may be provided through an attorney-directed authorized lane such as a storefront password, preview link, or temporary allowlist window.

If an authorized lane is subsequently provided by counsel, this determination will be superseded by a new intake determination reflecting the access conditions under which verification proceeded. The authorized lane and its source will be explicitly stated in the updated determination.
