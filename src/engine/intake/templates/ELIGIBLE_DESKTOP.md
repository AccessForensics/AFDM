INTAKE DETERMINATION
MATTER ID: [AF-YYYY-NNNN]

DETERMINATION: ELIGIBLE FOR DESKTOP TECHNICAL RECORD BUILD

Based on Access Forensics intake assessment of the complaint or demand materials provided, this matter qualifies for cryptographically sealed technical record production under our controlled capture protocols, limited to the claims asserted in the submitted materials.

This determination reflects feasibility under a bounded intake gate and does not quantify the number of conditions present or absent.

BASELINE EXECUTION CONTEXTS:
Desktop baseline is executed at 1366 x 900 CSS pixels at 100% browser zoom. Browser version is recorded in the execution log. Reflow is evaluated separately per WCAG 1.4.10 using both direct and zoom-path methods.

NEXT STEPS:
Full engagement involves execution under a defined desktop browser context pursuant to our controlled capture protocols. All capture artifacts are logged, time-stamped, and sealed within a structured evidentiary packet utilizing industry-standard cryptographic integrity verification (SHA-256) and documented chain-of-custody controls.

The evidentiary packet includes, as applicable to the claims asserted in the submitted materials: high-resolution screenshots, page source and DOM captures, rendered text extracts, network activity records including requests, responses, headers, and timing data, console and runtime logs, interaction and navigation logs, and environment metadata including viewport, user agent, device profile, and execution settings. Each artifact is indexed within a structured manifest and bound to a packet hash.

Execution parameters are documented to permit independent technical review under equivalent controlled conditions. The resulting record reflects the live site state at the time of capture and is confined to the claims asserted in the submitted materials. The evidentiary packet is structured to withstand technical examination and adversarial scrutiny.
